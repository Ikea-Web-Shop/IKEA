<strong>Thanks for sharing!</strong>
 
The IKEA vision is to create a better everyday life for the many people. That’s a big job, and one we at Inter IKEA
Systems B.V. take seriously.&nbsp; 
 
Who are the many people? You are! Whether you’re an IKEA customer, co worker or business partner, the IKEA vision
is all about you. So naturally we want to get to know you better.
 
 
One way we do that is by collecting your personal information. If you’re reading this, you’re probably curious
what information we collect and how we use it. Read on to find out.
 
 
Without your information, our job would be a lot harder. So thanks for sharing! We hope to make your everyday life better
in return.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. How we respect your privacy</strong>
 
Our approach at Inter IKEA Systems B.V. is to be as open and transparent as possible about how we collect and use your
information.
 
 
First, we let you know exactly what information we collect and why. You can read all about that in the next section.
 
 
Second, we let you know what we do with your information. Who do we share it with? What do they do with it? You can read
about that in section 3.
 
 
Third, we protect your information and let you know how long we keep it. Read about that in sections 4 and 5.
 
 
Finally, we let you know your choices when it comes to your personal information, including who to contact if you have
questions or requests. Read about that in sections 6 and 7.</p>
 
<p>
<strong>2. What information we collect and why</strong>
 
We want to make your IKEA experience great! To do that we collect several types of information about you.</p>
